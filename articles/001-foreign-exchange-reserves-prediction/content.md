### Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis

To ensure optimal model performance, a meticulous data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis phase was undertaken to enhance the quality and consistency of the dataset. This crucial step involved applying various techniques to prepare the data for modeling, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and data visualization.

### Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning

A comparative study was conducted on various machine learning models, each with its unique strengths and weaknesses. The final choice was the Prophet model, known for its robustness and accuracy in time series forecasting. A thorough hyperparameter tuning process was conducted to determine the optimal parameters for the Prophet model.

### Model Deployment and Visualization

The trained model was seamlessly deployed on Streamlit, transforming it into an interactive web application. This enabled users to interact with the model, visualize the forecasted results, and gain insights into India's foreign exchange reserves.

### Conclusion

This project showcases my proficiency in designing, developing, and deploying a machine learning model that can accurately forecast India's foreign exchange reserves using time series forecasting. The results underscore the efficacy of the proposed approach and highlight the vast potential of machine learning in finance and economics.
